## Create-React-App vs Next.js

Since this is a very basic app with limited functionality, I choose to use create-react-app. No routing was needed and Next.js seemed like overkill. However, Next.js would have been beneficial for utilizing an API to avoid the rate limit that Github imposes for unauthenticated users. Again, since this code is only for a technical challenge and not for a client, I didn't feel it was worth the time to set it up. The app works well without it and can demonstrate my skill as a develoer. Hope you enjoy!
